                I spent the last three years in Taiwan in global product management and managing relationships with technology partners in NA, EU, and APAC. I’m a seasoned platform and infrastructure Product Director with ten + years of experience in both start-up and big corporate settings.

                <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    I stared my career at an SF start-up, which has informed my builder's ethos for my entire career. Since then, I’ve worked across data companies of all sizes, learning how to operate within large corporate environments while maintaining a problem solver's mindset
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got a big break working on a research project intersection of ML and sports fandom at USC. That opportunity led me to New York City, where I helped build a data visualization practice and later expanded my work into data infrastructure and privacy-focused products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most recently, I worked at Samba TV in Taiwan, a San Francisco–based technology company specializing in TV viewership data. There, I partnered with SoC manufacturers and TV OS/OEMs to integrate and innovate on automatic content recognition and AI capabilities at the chipset level. Prior to that role, I completed a joint Executive MBA program run by UCLA and the National University of Singapore with a focus on technology and Asia, gaining a higher level of emotional intelligence and understanding how to work with institutional differences across regions.
